      <h1 style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-size: 2.5rem;">Visual Exploration of Rocketry & Propulsion</h1>
      <p style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2rem;">
        The purpose of this gallery is to showcase the diversity and evolution of aerospace engineering, specifically in rocketry and propulsion systems. Through carefully selected photographs, users can gain a closer understanding of the mechanical designs, historical milestones, and engineering marvels that have shaped space exploration.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2rem;">
        The first group focuses on <strong>inventory</strong> — highlighting a range of different aerospace objects from model rockets to full-size propulsion units and control modules. This visual catalog allows users to appreciate the variety of forms, materials, and functions within the aerospace field.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif; font-size: 1.2rem;">
        The second group emphasizes <strong>variation</strong> within a single type of object — for instance, different stages of propulsion systems or changes in spacecraft design philosophy over time. By examining these variations, users will learn how technology advances with new challenges and missions. Overall, this gallery serves to ignite curiosity, deepen understanding of rocket science, and encourage appreciation for the innovation that propels humanity into space.
