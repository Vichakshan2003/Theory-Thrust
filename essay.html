    <h1>Space Hazy Tour: A Visual Journal from Udvar-Hazy</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The first time I stepped into the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, I felt like I had just walked into a spaceship hangar from a sci-fi movie. Towering above me was the SR-71 Blackbird, cloaked in matte black, as if guarding the secrets of Cold War skies. That’s the moment you realize this isn’t just another museum visit—it’s a launchpad into aviation history.</p>
      <p>This journal is part of Thrust & Theory and captures a visual and emotional tour through aviation and aerospace history. It’s divided into three chapters—Stealth & Speed, Space & Ambition, and Wings of the Past—each pairing photography with narrative reflections. Come along for a walk through air and space like you’ve never experienced before.</p>

      <h2>Stealth & Speed</h2>

      <h3>SR-71 Blackbird</h3>

      <p class="caption">SR-71 Blackbird on display at the main entrance. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>With its razor-sharp frame and stealth-black finish, the Blackbird feels like a myth made real. It's the plane that set world records and slipped past enemy radar at Mach 3—your welcome committee to the center of aviation history.</p>

      <h3>F-14 Tomcat</h3>

      <p class="caption">F-14 Tomcat in pristine form. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>The Navy’s Cold War-era king of the skies, the Tomcat is known for its variable-sweep wings and Top Gun legacy. Seeing it up close reminds you of how design and danger can intersect in perfect balance.</p>

      <h3>German Rocket Jet</h3>

      <p>Scarred by time and urgency, this Nazi-era rocket jet is both haunting and fascinating. You’re reminded how desperate innovation during war accelerated aerospace history in ways we still study today.</p>

      <h2>Space & Ambition</h2>

      <h3>Space Shuttle Discovery</h3>
      <img src="pics/spaceshuttle.jpeg" alt="Space Shuttle Discovery">
      <p class="caption">The retired shuttle Discovery under museum lighting. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>Discovery looms over visitors, blackened tiles and all. It’s hard to grasp the weight—literal and symbolic—of the shuttle era until you’re standing beneath one.</p>

      <h3>Apollo Command Module</h3>
      <img src="pics/apollo11module.jpeg" alt="Apollo Command Module">
      <p class="caption">Boilerplate Apollo Command Module on exhibit. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>Though this module never flew, it tells a powerful story: of splashdowns, narrow escapes, and the engineers who got us to the Moon and back. The scorch marks and flotation gear bring reentry drama into sharp relief.</p>

      <h3>Concorde</h3>

      <p class="caption">British Airways Concorde, nose down for landing configuration. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>Long and sleek, the Concorde dominates the hangar’s side wing. It’s proof that flying faster than sound was not only possible—but once considered the future of commercial travel.</p>

      <h2>Wings of the Past</h2>

      <h3>WWII Bomber & Fighters</h3>
      <img src="pics/ww2bomber.jpeg" alt="WWII Bomber">
      <p class="caption">WWII aircraft collection featuring the B-29. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>Surrounded by history, the WWII bomber cluster includes the Enola Gay and its airborne peers. The riveted metal and massive scale contrast powerfully with the smooth lines of modern jets.</p>

      <h3>Propeller Aircraft</h3>
      <img src="pics/propellerjet.jpeg" alt="Propeller Aircraft">
      <p class="caption">World War II fighter planes preserved with authenticity. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>These fighters are smaller but no less fierce. They tell the story of dogfights, carrier launches, and hands-on flying—before digital cockpits and stealthy coatings changed everything.</p>

      <h3>Seaplanes</h3>
      <img src="pics/waterplane.jpeg" alt="Seaplane">
      <p class="caption">Seaplanes hover overhead in flight formation. Image taken by: Vick Maturu</p>
      <p>Hanging from the ceiling, seaplanes capture the romance of a bygone age. Water takeoffs. Jungle rescues. Island landings. Aviation wasn’t just about speed—it was about access.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Each aircraft at the Udvar-Hazy Center is more than a machine—it’s a frozen moment in our climb skyward. From WWII bombers to Space Shuttles, each photo I captured tells a story of human ingenuity and courage. This journal was my way of documenting awe, learning, and inspiration.</p>
      <p>So what did I learn? That innovation never sits still, and that flight—whether military, commercial, or exploratory—represents the best of what humans can build. The next time I visit, I’ll bring new questions and a longer lens. Because in a place like this, there’s always another angle worth capturing.</p>
