      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <p><strong>Thrust & Theory</strong> is a creative exploration of rocketry, propulsion systems, and aerospace storytelling. The project brings together visuals, interactivity, and scientific depth — offering a window into how we break through Earth’s atmosphere and aim for the stars.</p>
      <p>This site was built as part of a web authoring course, but its purpose stretches beyond the classroom: to spark curiosity and appreciation for the incredible science behind space travel.</p>
